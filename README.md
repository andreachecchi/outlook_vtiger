# Outlook to VTiger Email Integration

This project provides an add-in for quickly integrating Outlook emails into VTiger CRM. By leveraging VTiger's standard API, the add-in allows users to streamline the process of attaching email content to the CRM as part of their project management workflow.  

With this tool, the textual content of emails can be seamlessly added to a **Project Task**, ensuring better organization and tracking within VTiger. A **Project** is required to associate the task, making it a valuable solution for teams relying on VTiger for project-based activities.  

## Key Features
- **Easy Configuration**: Requires VTiger credentials (username and access key) and the base URL where VTiger is installed.
- **HTTPS Compatibility**: VTiger must be accessible over HTTPS for security.
- **Basic Authentication Support**: If VTiger is behind a Basic Authentication, credentials can be provided; otherwise, leave the fields empty.
- **Streamlined Email Management**: Automatically attaches the textual content of emails to Project Tasks in VTiger.
- **Project Association**: Each task requires a Project for proper categorization and tracking.
